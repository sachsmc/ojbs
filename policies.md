## Open Access

As a matter of principle, we do not charge any author fees or subscription fees. All content is published electronically and is made available free of charge under a [CC-BY License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) and all code is made available under a [GPL-Compatible License](https://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses). The editors, reviewers, and programmers are all volunteers committed to the advancement of the statistical sciences. 

## Reproducibility

All articles that contain results that depend on computer software are required to submit their code along with the manuscript. An independent reviewer should be able to reproduce the results in the paper. We encourage all authors to develop companion software for their methods that can be used more broadly. 

If possible, manuscripts should be written as dynamic documents, that contain both code to be evaluated and the prose. We provide article templates for both Latex and Markdown that are compatible with the R package knitr. 

## Review Process

We employ a typical peer review process for submitted manuscripts. 

### Editorial Review and Triage

The editor-in-chief selects an editor for the initial review. At this stage, the manuscript may be rejected if it is determined that it is not appropriate for the journal. If the submission does not meet the required format and specifications, it may be returned for resubmission. Otherwise, 2 peer reviewers are selected for the initial review. This process is completed within 10 business days.

### Initial Review

The 2 peer reviewers assess the manuscript and provide a written summary of the paper, a list of major issues, a list of minor issues, and recommendation to the editor. 

A major issue has to be one of the following: (1) a claim that is not supported by the data, (2) a method or result that appears completely incorrect, (3) a critical missing piece of information, or (4) a paper that is not readable by a person trying their best to understand it.

Minor issues include issues with clarity and exposition, additional simulation or analysis results, or suggestions on extraneous results or discussion. 

The reviewers make recommendations to either reject, revise and return to reviewers, or accept pending minor revisions. 

This review process is completed within 15 business days. 

### Code Review

If the decision is to accept, a third reviewer is brought in to review the code that generates the manuscript and the main results, if applicable. The goal of this review is to ensure the correctness of the results so that the code may be useful to readers. If accepted, the code/data will be published along with the manuscript. This process is completed within 10 days of acceptance. If there are any issues, the reviewer will contact the authors through the review management system.

## Publication

All articles must be rendered using pdflatex with the ojbs.cls document class. Since we are volunteers, we cannot provide latex support to authors. We do provide templates in both latex and markdown, the latter of which is very easy to use and learn. A tutorial for preparing manuscripts in markdown is being developed. 

Every 10 articles is published as a volume. Each article is published as an issue, and there are no page limits. We do encourage authors to be focused and concise, and recognize that extremely lengthy articles (more than 20 rendered pages) may delay the review process.
